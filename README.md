# Internship Experience at Virtunexa
I am Rohit Ramesh Mhetre, a Front-End Developer Intern at Virtunexa (Intern ID: VN-FD-4W204). From 16-Jan-2025 to 15-Feb-2025, I had the opportunity to work on exciting projects that helped me grow my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This internship provided me with hands-on experience in building responsive and interactive web applications, and I am grateful to Virtunexa for this invaluable learning opportunity. Below, I have summarized the tasks I completed during this internship.

# Task 1: Architecture Landing Page
My first task was to create a landing page focused on architecture. The page included sections such as "What is Architecture?", "Importance of Architecture," and "Famous Architects and Their Contributions." I designed a clean and user-friendly interface with a consistent header and footer for easy navigation. This project helped me strengthen my foundational skills in HTML and CSS while learning to structure content effectively.

# Task 2: CSS Animations Showcase
For the second task, I designed a hotel room booking landing page with interactive CSS animations. The page featured a room gallery, a booking section, and user controls to customize animation speed, effects, and properties. I also added navigation links like Home, About, Sign Up, and Book Now. This task allowed me to explore creative ways to use CSS animations and improve the visual appeal of web pages.

# Task 3: Interactive Video Player
The third task involved building an interactive video player with custom controls. I added features like a progress bar, playback speed options, and buttons for play, pause, and volume control. The video content focused on DSA learning and a DSA roadmap. Additionally, I included a "Contact Us" section for user inquiries. This project enhanced my understanding of JavaScript and media handling in web development.

# Task 4: Multi-Step Form with Progress Tracking
For the final task, I developed a multi-step form for coding language classes. The form included progress tracking, validation, and a section for student testimonials titled "What Our Students Say." I also added navigation links like Home, Sign Up, Login, and Reviews. This task taught me how to create user-friendly forms with seamless navigation and validation, ensuring a smooth user experience.

This internship at Virtunexa was a rewarding experience that allowed me to apply my skills to real-world projects. I am thankful for the guidance and support provided by the Virtunexa team, and I look forward to leveraging these learnings in my future endeavors.
